<p><b>Keaton Ferber -  Student ID: s3952394</b><br>
My name is Keaton Ferber, I live in a small town in rural SA. I graduated Year 12 in 2014 and have previously worked as a cellar hand at a local winery for many years. My main hobby is playing video games, its something I’ve enjoyed since I was very young. I also enjoy watching movies, TV and anime. I’m a huge Star Wars fan and my favourite movie they have released is Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. My friend got me into watching F1 in 2020 and I’ve been following avidly since. I root for Ferrari and my favourite driver is Charles Leclerc. I love cats and have a cat named Ezra; he keeps me company.<br>
My interest in IT started at a young age. My interest with technology started with playing video games on our PlayStation 2, but I also spent a lot of time on our family desktop computer. I’ve always found computers fascinating and enjoyed tinkering with them. For my research project in high school, I built my own desktop computer. I really enjoyed the process and still build and upgrade my PCs to this day. I chose to study at RMIT as I was looking to Study IT through Open Universities Australia (OUA), and RMIT was recommended. I expect to learn the skills required for my chosen career.
