    </div>
<p><b></b><br>
My name is Dean Heighway and I'm a 27-year-old born in Australia and of Australian decent, in my lifetime I&rsquo;ve only ever spoken English and I've learned beginner levels or Italian. My highest level of education is finishing the HSC and also, I have completed a semester of a bachelor of nutrition.
<br>I love all sports but have a keen interest in cricket, currently my season has just finished last week as my team lost in the semifinals however, I am enjoying watching the current tour of Australia to Pakistan.
My interest in IT stems from a long history of video games and love of computers, ever since I was four years old, I remember playing Warcraft 2 and StarCraft with my dad in his spare time and from then I was hooked in gaming. Over time my love of gaming developed into wanting a further understanding of the ins and outs of computers and the how and why of games; what powers them? How are they built?
<br>
I have very limited IT experience at the moment but its quickly growing throughout the duration of this course. I choose RMIT for my studies as it is one of the leading IT programs in the country and it also offers the convenience of online study, being someone who full time works I can&rsquo;t attend standard university so I opt for the convenience of online. I expect to obtain a greater understanding of how computers work both internally and externally as well as a deeper understanding and competency of programming languages.<font color = #F4181C > Condense into one paragraph.</font>
