<center><h1>Hi there!</h1></center>
<div style=margin:60px>
  <h2>Welcome to the website of Thirty Seven! We are a group of four students studying Introduction to Information Technology at RMIT University. This website has been updated since the first group assignment and encompasses a refined overview and application mock up of the group's project - ShopMate. Due to the limited knowledge in developing an app, the project showcase offers and demonstrates a proof of concept module only and not an interactive finished product, as it is a concept that needs further work and ongoing development to complete the first release of the product idea. <br><br>Over the past few weeks, the group have been able to reassess their career goals and movements as to what the future may look like for them, as well as further exploration with a broader spectrum of programs and tools. <br><br>
	  Tools will have links to our Github repository, our meetings in teams and their agendas, references and any supplementary information.<br><br>
	  We hope you enjoy our closing presentation for Introduction to Information Technology!<br>
